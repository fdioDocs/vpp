   FD.io VPP Communication Through Low Level API

One approach is to implement a FD.io VPP application to communicate with an
external application within a local environment (Linux host or
container). The communication would occur through a low level API. This
approach offers a complete, feature rich solution that is simple yet
high performance. For example, it is reasonable to expect performance
yields of 500k routes/second.

This approach takes advantage of using a shared memory/message queue.
The implementation is on a local on a box or container. All CLI tasks
can be done through API calls.

The current implementation of the FD.io VPP platform generates Low Level
Bindings for C, Java, and Python clients. It's possible for future
support to be provided for bindings for other programming languages.

Remote Programmability
----------------------

Another approach is to use a Data Plane Management Agent through a High
Level API. As shown in the figure, a Data Plane Management Agent can
speak through a low level API to the FD.io VPP App (engine). This can run
locally in a box (or VM or container). The box (or container) would
expose higher level APIs through some form of binding.

This is a particularly flexible approach because the FD.io VPP platform does
not force a particular Data Plane Management Agent. Furthermore, the FD.io VPP
platform does not restrict communication to only \*one\* high level API.
Anybody can bring a Data Plane Management Agent. This allows you to
match the high level API/Data Plane Management Agent and implementation
to the specific needs of the FD.io VPP app.

ODL Honeycomb Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One example of using a high hevel API is to implement the FD.io VPP platform
as an app on a box that is running a local ODL instance (Honeycomb). You
could use a low level API over generated Java Bindings to talk to the
FD.io VPP App, and expose Yang Models over netconf/restconf NB.

This would be one way to implement Bridge Domains.
