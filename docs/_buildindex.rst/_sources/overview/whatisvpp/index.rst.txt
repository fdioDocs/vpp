What is VPP?
=========================================

The FD.io VPP platform is an extensible framework that provides out-of-the-box
production quality switch/router functionality. The FD.io's Vector Packet Processing (VPP)
technology is a high performance, packet-processing stack that can run on commodity CPUs.

The benefits of this implementation of FD.io VPP are its high performance,
proven technology, its modularity and flexibility, and rich feature set.

.. note::

    Todo: Will add more detail on vendors later, line that was ommitted: "FD.io VPP is a productized commercial-grade network stack that has been use in products since 2002, 
    by a number of vendors including Cisco and ZTE."

.. note::

    Todo: Have a short definition of a graph node

It is a modular design. The framework allows anyone to "plug in" new graph nodes without the need to change core code.
