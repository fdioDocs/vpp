******************************
Network Stack Layer (src/vnet)
******************************

The Network Stack Layer has a vnet library that provides vectorized layer-2 and 3 networking graph
nodes, a packet generator, and a packet tracer. The files for this function are located in the â€¦/src/vnet folder.

Vnet
====

In terms of building a packet processing application, vnet provides a
platform-independent subgraph to which one connects a couple of
device-driver nodes.

Typical RX connections include "ethernet-input" [full software
classification, feeds ipv4-input, ipv6-input, arp-input etc.] and
"ipv4-input-no-checksum" [if hardware can classify, perform ipv4
header checksum].

Effective graph dispatch function coding
----------------------------------------

Over the 15 years, two distinct styles have emerged: a
single/dual/quad loop coding model and a fully-pipelined coding
model. We seldom use the fully-pipelined coding model, so we won't
describe it in any detail.

Single/dual loops
-----------------

The single/dual/quad loop model is the only way to conveniently solve
problems where the number of items to process is not known in advance:
typical hardware RX-ring processing. This coding style is also very
effective when a given node will not need to cover a complex set of
dependent reads.
