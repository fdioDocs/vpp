   Add Overview Section.

The fd.io vpp implementation is a third-generation vector packet
processing implementation specifically related to US Patent 7,961,636,
as well as earlier work. Note that the Apache-2 license specifically
grants non-exclusive patent licenses; we mention this patent as a
point of historical interest.

For performance, the vpp dataplane consists of a directed graph of
forwarding nodes which process multiple packets per invocation. This
schema enables a variety of micro-processor optimizations: pipelining
and prefetching to cover dependent read latency, inherent I-cache
phase behavior, vector instructions. Aside from hardware input and hardware output nodes,
the entire forwarding graph is portable code.

Depending on the scenario at hand, we often spin up multiple worker
threads which process ingress-hashes packets from multiple queues using
identical forwarding graph replicas. 

Implemetation taxonomy
======================

The vpp dataplane consists of four distinct layers: 

* An infrastructure layer comprising vppinfra, vlib, svm, and binary api libraries. See .../src/{vppinfra, vlib, svm, vlibapi, vlibmemory}

* A generic network stack layer: vnet. See .../src/vnet

* An application shell: vpp. See .../src/vpp

* An increasingly rich set of data-plane plugins: see .../src/plugins

It's important to understand each of these layers in a certain amount
of detail. Much of the implementation is best dealt with at the API
level and otherwise left alone.

Vppinfra
========

Vppinfra is a collection of basic c-library services, quite sufficient
to build standalone programs to run directly on bare metal. It also
provides high-performance dynamic arrays, hashes, bitmaps,
high-precision real-time clock support, fine-grained event-logging,
and data structure serialization.

One fair comment / fair warning about vppinfra: you can't always tell
a macro from an inline function from an ordinary function simply by
name. Macros are used to avoid function calls in the typical case, and
to cause (intentional) side-effects.

Vppinfra has been around for almost 20 years and tends not to change frequently.

Vectors
-------

Vppinfra vectors are ubiquitous dynamically resized arrays with by
user defined "headers". Many vpppinfra data structures (e.g. hash,
heap, pool) are vectors with various different headers.
 
The memory layout looks like this::

                   User header (optional, uword aligned)
                   Alignment padding (if needed)
                   Vector length in elements
 User's pointer -> Vector element 0
                   Vector element 1
                   ...
                   Vector element N-1

As shown above, the vector APIs deal with pointers to the 0th element
of a vector. Null pointers are valid vectors of length zero. 

To avoid thrashing the memory allocator, one often resets the length
of a vector to zero while retaining the memory allocation. Set the
vector length field to zero via the vec_reset_length(v) macro. [Use
the macro! It's smart about NULL pointers.]  

Typically, the user header is not present. User headers allow for
other data structures to be built atop vppinfra vectors.  Users may
specify the alignment for data elements via the vec_*_aligned macros.

Vectors elements can be any C type e.g. (int, double, struct
bar). This is also true for data types built atop vectors (e.g. heap,
pool, etc.).  Many macros have _a variants supporting alignment of
vector data and _h variants supporting non-zero-length vector
headers. The _ha variants support both. 

Inconsistent usage of header and/or alignment related macro variants
will cause delayed, confusing failures.  

Standard programming error: memorize a pointer to the ith element of a
vector, and then expand the vector. Vectors expand by 3/2, so such
code may appear to work for a period of time. Correct code almost
always memorizes vector **indices** which are invariant across
reallocations.  

In typical application images, one supplies a set of global functions
designed to be called from gdb. Here are a few examples:

* vl(v) - prints vec_len(v)
* pe(p) - prints pool_elts(p)
* pifi(p, index) - prints pool_is_free_index(p, index)
* debug_hex_bytes (p, nbytes) - hex memory dump nbytes starting at p

Use the "show gdb" debug CLI command to print the current set.

Bitmaps
-------

Vppinfra bitmaps are dynamic, built using the vppinfra vector
APIs. Quite handy for a variety jobs. 

Pools
-----

Vppinfra pools combine vectors and bitmaps to rapidly allocate and
free fixed-size data structures with independent lifetimes. Pools are
perfect for allocating per-session structures. 

Hashes
------

Vppinfra provides several hash flavors. Data plane problems involving
packet classification / session lookup often use
.../src/vppinfra/bihash_template.[ch] bounded-index extensible
hashes. These templates are instantiated multiple times, to
efficiently service different fixed-key sizes.

Bihashes are thread-safe. Read-locking is not required. A simple
spin-lock ensures that only one thread writes an entry at a time. 

The original vppinfra hash implementation in .../src/vppinfra/hash.[ch] are simple to use, and are often used in control-plane code which needs exact-string-matching.

In either case, one almost always looks up a key in a hash table to
obtain an index in a related vector or pool. The APIs are simple
enough, but one must take care when using the unmanaged
arbitrary-sized key variant. Hash_set_mem (hash_table, key_pointer,
value) memorizes key_pointer. It is usually a bad mistake to pass the
address of a vector element as the second argument to hash_set_mem. It
is perfectly fine to memorize constant string addresses in the text
segment.

Format
------

Vppinfra format is roughly equivalent to printf. 

Format has a few properties worth mentioning. Format's first argument
is a (u8 \*) vector to which it appends the result of the current
format operation.  Chaining calls is very easy::

  u8 * result;

  result = format (0, "junk = %d, ", junk);
  result = format (result, "more junk = %d\n", more_junk);

As previously noted, NULL pointers are perfectly proper 0-length
vectors. Format returns a (u8 \*) vector, **not** a C-string. If you
wish to print a (u8 \*) vector, use the "%v" format string. If you need
a (u8 \*) vector which is also a proper C-string, either of these
schemes may be used::

  vec_add1 (result, 0)
  or 
  result = format (result, "<whatever>%c", 0); 

Remember to vec_free() the result if appropriate. Be careful not to
pass format an uninitialized u8 \*.

Format implements a particularly handy user-format scheme via the "%U"
format specification. For example::

  u8 * format_junk (u8 * s, va_list *va)
  {
    junk = va_arg (va, u32);
    s = format (s, "%s", junk);
    return s;
  }
  
  result = format (0, "junk = %U, format_junk, "This is some junk");

format_junk() can invoke other user-format functions if desired. The
programmer shoulders responsibility for argument type-checking. It is
typical for user format functions to blow up if the va_arg(va, <type>)
macros don't match the caller's idea of reality.

Unformat
--------

Vppinfra unformat is vaguely related to scanf, but considerably more general.

A typical use case involves initializing an unformat_input_t from
either a C-string or a (u8 \*) vector, then parsing via unformat() as
follows::

  unformat_input_t input;

  unformat_init_string (&input, "<some-C-string>");
  /* or */
  unformat_init_vector (&input, <u8-vector>);

Then loop parsing individual elements::

  while (unformat_check_input (&input) != UNFORMAT_END_OF_INPUT) 
  {
    if (unformat (&input, "value1 %d", &value1))
      ;/* unformat sets value1 */
    else if (unformat (&input, "value2 %d", &value2)
      ;/* unformat sets value2 */
    else
      return clib_error_return (0, "unknown input '%U'", format_unformat_error, 
                                input);
  } 

As with format, unformat implements a user-unformat function
capability via a "%U" user unformat function scheme.

Vppinfra errors and warnings
----------------------------

Many functions within the vpp dataplane have return-values of type
clib_error_t \*. Clib_error_t'ss are arbitrary strings with a
bit of metadata [fatal, warning] and are easy to announce. Returning
a NULL clib_error_t \* indicates "A-OK, no error." 

Clib_warning(<format-args>) is a handy way to add debugging output;
clib warnings prepend function:line info to unambiguously locate the
message source.  Clib_unix_warning() adds perror()-style Linux
system-call information. In production images, clib_warnings result in
syslog entries.

Serialization
-------------

Vppinfra serialization support allows the programmer to easily serialize and unserialize complex data structures. 

The underlying primitive serialize/unserialize functions use network
byte-order, so there are no structural issues serializing on a
little-endian host and unserializing on a big-endian host.

Event-logger, graphical event log viewer
----------------------------------------

The vppinfra event logger provides very lightweight (sub-100ns)
precisely time-stamped event-logging services. See
.../src/vppinfra/{elog.c, elog.h}

Serialization support makes it easy to save and ultimately to combine
a set of event logs. In a distributed system running NTP over a local
LAN, we find that event logs collected from multiple system elements
can be combined with a temporal uncertainty no worse than 50us.


A typical event definition and logging call looks like this::

  ELOG_TYPE_DECLARE (e) = 
  {
    .format = "tx-msg: stream %d local seq %d attempt %d",
    .format_args = "i4i4i4",
  };
  struct { u32 stream_id, local_sequence, retry_count; } * ed;
  ed = ELOG_DATA (m->elog_main, e);
  ed->stream_id = stream_id;
  ed->local_sequence = local_sequence;
  ed->retry_count = retry_count;

The ELOG_DATA macro returns a pointer to 20 bytes worth of arbitrary
event data, to be formatted (offline, not at runtime) as described by
format_args. Aside from obvious integer formats, the CLIB event logger
provides a couple of interesting additions. The "t4" format
pretty-prints enumerated values::

  ELOG_TYPE_DECLARE (e) = 
  {
    .format = "get_or_create: %s",
    .format_args = "t4",
    .n_enum_strings = 2,
    .enum_strings = { "old", "new", },
  };

The "t" format specifier indicates that the corresponding datum is an
index in the event's set of enumerated strings, as shown in the
previous event type definition.

The “T” format specifier indicates that the corresponding datum is an
index in the event log’s string heap. This allows the programmer to
emit arbitrary formatted strings. One often combines this facility
with a hash table to keep the event-log string heap from growing
arbitrarily large.

Noting the 20-octet limit per-log-entry data field, the event log
formatter supports arbitrary combinations of these data types. As in:
the ".format" field may contain one or more instances of the
following:

* i1 - 8-bit unsigned integer
* i2 - 16-bit unsigned integer
* i4 - 32-bit unsigned integer
* i8 - 64-bit unsigned integer
* f4 - float
* f8 - double
* s - NULL-terminated string - be careful
* sN - N-byte character array
* t1,2,4 - per-event enumeration ID
* T4 - Event-log string table offset

The vpp engine event log is thread-safe, and is shared by all
threads. Take care not to serialize the computation. Although the
event-logger is about as fast as practicable, it's not appropriate for
per-packet use in hard-core data plane code. It's most appropriate for
capturing rare events - link up-down events, specific control-plane
events and so forth.

The vpp engine has several debug CLI commands for manipulating its event log::

  vpp# event-logger clear
  vpp# event-logger save <filename> # for security, writes into /tmp/<filename>.
                                    # <filename> must not contain '.' or '/' characters
  vpp# show event-logger [all] [<nnn>] # display the event log
                                     # by default, the last 250 entries
  
The event log defaults to 128K entries. The command-line argument
"... vlib { elog-events <nnn> }" configures the size of the event log.

As described above, the vpp engine event log is thread-safe and
shared. To avoid confusing non-appearance of events logged by worker
threads, make sure to code &vlib_global_main.elog_main - instead of
&vm->elog_main. The latter form is correct in the main thread, but
will almost certainly produce bad results in worker threads.

G2 graphical event viewer
-------------------------

The g2 graphical event viewer can display serialized vppinfra event
logs directly, or via the c2cpel tool.

VLIB
====

Vlib provides vector processing support including graph-node
scheduling, reliable multicast support, ultra-lightweight cooperative
multi-tasking threads, a CLI, plug in .DLL support, physical memory
and Linux epoll support. Parts of this library embody US Patent
7,961,636.

Init function discovery
-----------------------


vlib applications register for various [initialization] events by
placing structures and __attribute__((constructor)) functions into the
image. At appropriate times, the vlib framework walks
constructor-generated singly-linked structure lists, calling the
indicated functions. vlib applications create graph nodes, add CLI
functions, start cooperative multi-tasking threads, etc. etc. using
this mechanism.

vlib applications invariably include a number of VLIB_INIT_FUNCTION
(my_init_function) macros.

Each init / configure / etc. function has the return type clib_error_t
\*. Make sure that the function returns 0 if all is well, otherwise
the framework will announce an error and exit.

vlib applications must link against vppinfra, and often link against
other libraries such as VNET. In the latter case, it may be necessary
to explicitly reference symbol(s) otherwise large portions of the
library may be AWOL at runtime.

Node Graph Initialization
-------------------------

vlib packet-processing applications invariably define a set of graph
nodes to process packets. 

One constructs a vlib_node_registration_t, most often via the
VLIB_REGISTER_NODE macro. At runtime, the framework processes the set
of such registrations into a directed graph. It is easy enough to add
nodes to the graph at runtime. The framework does not support removing
nodes.

vlib provides several types of vector-processing graph nodes,
primarily to control framework dispatch behaviors. The type member of
the vlib_node_registration_t functions as follows:

* VLIB_NODE_TYPE_PRE_INPUT - run before all other node types
* VLIB_NODE_TYPE_INPUT - run as often as possible, after pre_input nodes
* VLIB_NODE_TYPE_INTERNAL - only when explicitly made runnable by adding pending frames for processing
* VLIB_NODE_TYPE_PROCESS - only when explicitly made runnable. "Process" nodes are actually cooperative multi-tasking threads. They **must** explicitly suspend after a reasonably short period of time.
  
For a precise understanding of the graph node dispatcher, please read
.../src/vlib/main.c:vlib_main_loop.
 
Graph node dispatcher
---------------------

Vlib_main_loop() dispatches graph nodes. The basic vector processing
algorithm is diabolically simple, but may not be obvious from even a
long stare at the code. Here's how it works: some input node, or
set of input nodes, produce a vector of work to process. The graph
node dispatcher pushes the work vector through the directed graph,
subdividing it as needed, until the original work vector has been
completely processed. At that point, the process recurs.

This scheme yields a stable equilibrium in frame size, by
construction. Here's why: as the frame size increases, the
per-frame-element processing time decreases. There are several related
forces at work; the simplest to describe is the effect of vector
processing on the CPU L1 I-cache. The first frame element [packet]
processed by a given node warms up the node dispatch function in the
L1 I-cache. All subsequent frame elements profit. As we increase the
number of frame elements, the cost per element goes down.

Under light load, it is a crazy waste of CPU cycles to run the graph
node dispatcher flat-out. So, the graph node dispatcher arranges to
wait for work by sitting in a timed epoll wait if the prevailing frame
size is low. The scheme has a certain amount of hysteresis to avoid
constantly toggling back and forth between interrupt and polling
mode. Although the graph dispatcher supports interrupt and polling
modes, our current default device drivers do not.

The graph node scheduler uses a hierarchical timer wheel to reschedule
process nodes upon timer expiration.  

Process / thread model
----------------------

vlib provides an ultra-lightweight cooperative multi-tasking thread
model. The graph node scheduler invokes these processes in much the
same way as traditional vector-processing run-to-completion graph
nodes; plus-or-minus a setjmp/longjmp pair required to switch
stacks. Simply set the vlib_node_registration_t type field to
vlib_NODE_TYPE_PROCESS. Yes, process is a misnomer. These are
cooperative multi-tasking threads. 

As of this writing, the default stack size is 2<<15; 32kb. Initialize
the node registration's process_log2_n_stack_bytes member as
needed. The graph node dispatcher makes some effort to detect stack
overrun, e.g. by mapping a no-access page below each thread stack.

Process node dispatch functions are expected to be "while(1) { }" loops
which suspend when not otherwise occupied, and which must not run for
unreasonably long periods of time. 

"Unreasonably long" is an application-dependent concept. Over the
years, we have constructed frame-size sensitive control-plane nodes
which will use a much higher fraction of the available CPU bandwidth
when the frame size is low. The classic example: modifying forwarding
tables. So long as the table-builder leaves the forwarding tables in a
valid state, one can suspend the table builder to avoid dropping
packets as a result of control-plane activity.

Process nodes can suspend for fixed amounts of time, or until another
entity signals an event, or both. See the next section for a
description of the vlib process event mechanism.

When running in vlib process context, one must pay strict attention to
loop invariant issues. If one walks a data structure and calls a
function which may suspend, one had best know by construction that it
cannot change. Often, it's best to simply make a snapshot copy of a
data structure, walk the copy at leisure, then free the copy.

Process events
--------------

The vlib process event mechanism API is extremely lightweight and easy
to use. Here is a typical example::

  vlib_main_t *vm = &vlib_global_main;
  uword event_type, * event_data = 0;

  while (1) 
  {
     vlib_process_wait_for_event_or_clock (vm, 5.0 /* seconds */);

     event_type = vlib_process_get_events (vm, &event_data);

     switch (event_type) {
     case EVENT1:
         handle_event1s (event_data);
         break;

     case EVENT2:
         handle_event2s (event_data);
         break; 

     case ~0: /* 5-second idle/periodic */
         handle_idle ();
         break;

     default: /* bug! */
         ASSERT (0);
     }

     vec_reset_length(event_data);
  } 

In this example, the VLIB process node waits for an event to occur, or
for 5 seconds to elapse. The code demuxes on the event type, calling
the appropriate handler function. Each call to vlib_process_get_events
returns a vector of per-event-type data passed to successive
vlib_process_signal_event calls; vec_len (event_data) >= 1.  

It is an error to process only event_data[0].

Resetting the event_data vector-length to 0 [instead of calling
vec_free] means that the event scheme doesn't burn cycles continuously
allocating and freeing the event data vector. This is a common
vppinfra / vlib coding pattern, well worth using when appropriate.

Signaling an event is easy, for example::

  vlib_process_signal_event (vm, process_node_index, EVENT1,
      (uword)arbitrary_event1_data); /* and so forth */

One can either know the process node index by construction - dig it
out of the appropriate vlib_node_registration_t - or by finding the
vlib_node_t with vlib_get_node_by_name(...).

Buffers
-------

vlib buffering solves the usual set of packet-processing problems,
albeit at high performance. Key in terms of performance: one
ordinarily allocates / frees N buffers at a time rather than one at a
time. Except when operating directly on a specific buffer, one deals
with buffers by index, not by pointer. 

Packet-processing frames are effectively u32[], not
vlib_buffer_t[]. 

Packets comprise one or more vlib buffers, chained together as
required. Multiple particle sizes are supported; hardware input nodes
simply ask for the required size(s). Coalescing support is
available. For obvious reasons one is discouraged from writing one's
own wild and wacky buffer chain traversal code.

vlib buffer headers are allocated immediately prior to the buffer data
area. In typical packet processing this saves a dependent read wait:
given a buffer's address, one can prefetch the buffer header
[metadata] at the same time as the first cache line of buffer data.

Buffer header metadata (vlib_buffer_t) includes the usual rewrite
expansion space, a current_data offset, RX and TX interface indices,
packet trace information, and a opaque areas.

The opaque data is intended to control packet processing in arbitrary
subgraph-dependent ways. The programmer shoulders responsibility for
data lifetime analysis, type-checking, etc.

Buffers have reference-counts in support of e.g. multicast
replication.

Shared-memory message API
-------------------------

Local control-plane and application processes interact with the vpp
dataplane via asynchronous message-passing in shared memory over
unidirectional queues. The same application APIs are available via
sockets. 

Capturing API traces and replaying them in a
simulation environment requires a disciplined approach
to the problem. This seems like a make-work task, but it is not. When
something goes wrong in the control-plane after 300,000 or 3,000,000
operations, high-speed replay of the events leading up to the accident
is a huge win. 

The shared-memory message API message allocator vl_api_msg_alloc uses
a particularly cute trick. Since messages are processed in order, we
try to allocate message buffering from a set of fixed-size,
preallocated rings. Each ring item has a "busy" bit. Freeing one of
the preallocated message buffers merely requires the message consumer
to clear the busy bit. No locking required.

Plug-ins
--------

vlib implements a straightforward plug-in DLL
mechanism. VLIB client applications specify a directory to search for
plug-in .DLLs, and a name filter to apply (if desired). VLIB needs to
load plug-ins very early.

Once loaded, the plug-in DLL mechanism uses dlsym to find and verify
a vlib_plugin_registration data structure in the newly-loaded
plug-in. 


Debug CLI
---------

Adding debug CLI commands to VLIB applications is very simple.

Here is a complete example::

  static clib_error_t *
  show_ip_tuple_match (vlib_main_t * vm,
                       unformat_input_t * input,
                       vlib_cli_command_t * cmd)
  {
      vlib_cli_output (vm, "%U\n", format_ip_tuple_match_tables, &routing_main);
      return 0;
  }

  static VLIB_CLI_COMMAND (show_ip_tuple_command) = {
      .path = "show ip tuple match",
      .short_help = "Show ip 5-tuple match-and-broadcast tables",
      .function = show_ip_tuple_match,
  };

This example implements the "show ip tuple match" debug cli
command. In ordinary usage, the vlib cli is available via the "vppctl"
applicationn, which sends traffic to a named pipe. One can configure
debug CLI telnet access on a configurable port.

The cli implementation has an output redirection facility which makes
it simple to deliver cli output via shared-memory API messaging,

Particularly for debug or "show tech support" type commands, it would
be wasteful to write vlib application code to pack binary data, write
more code elsewhere to unpack the data and finally print the
answer. If a certain cli command has the potential to hurt packet
processing performance by running for too long, do the work
incrementally in a process node. The client can wait.

Packet tracer
-------------

Vlib includes a frame element [packet] trace facility, with a simple
vlib cli interface. The cli is straightforward: "trace add
<input-node-name> <count>".  

To trace 100 packets on a typical x86_64 system running the dpdk
plugin: "trace add dpdk-input 100". When using the packet generator:
"trace add pg-input 100"

Each graph node has the opportunity to capture its own trace data. It
is almost always a good idea to do so. The trace capture APIs are
simple. 

The packet capture APIs snapshoot binary data, to minimize processing
at capture time. Each participating graph node initialization provides
a vppinfra format-style user function to pretty-print data when required
by the VLIB "show trace" command.

Set the VLIB node registration ".format_trace" member to the name of the per-graph node format function. 

Here's a simple example::

  u8 * my_node_format_trace (u8 * s, va_list * args)
  {
      vlib_main_t * vm = va_arg (*args, vlib_main_t *);
      vlib_node_t * node = va_arg (*args, vlib_node_t *);
      my_node_trace_t * t = va_arg (*args, my_trace_t *);

      s = format (s, "My trace data was: %d", t-><whatever>);

      return s;
  } 

The trace framework hands the per-node format function the data it
captured as the packet whizzed by. The format function pretty-prints
the data as desired. 

Vnet
====

The vnet library provides vectorized layer-2 and 3 networking graph
nodes, a packet generator, and a packet tracer.

In terms of building a packet processing application, vnet provides a
platform-independent subgraph to which one connects a couple of
device-driver nodes.

Typical RX connections include "ethernet-input" [full software
classification, feeds ipv4-input, ipv6-input, arp-input etc.] and
"ipv4-input-no-checksum" [if hardware can classify, perform ipv4
header checksum].

Effective graph dispatch function coding
----------------------------------------

Over the 15 years, two distinct styles have emerged: a
single/dual/quad loop coding model and a fully-pipelined coding
model. We seldom use the fully-pipelined coding model, so we won't
describe it in any detail

Single/dual loops
-----------------

The single/dual/quad loop model is the only way to conveniently solve
problems where the number of items to process is not known in advance:
typical hardware RX-ring processing. This coding style is also very
effective when a given node will not need to cover a complex set of
dependent reads.
