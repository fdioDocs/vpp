Summary / Purpose of VPP Configuration Utility
-------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the VPP configuration utility is to allow the user to
configure VPP in a simple and safe manner. The utility takes input from
the user and then modifies the key configuration files. The user can
then examine these files to be sure they are correct and then actually
apply the configuration. The utility also includes an installation
utility and some basic tests. This utility is currently released with
release 17.10.

Use
---

The installation and executing of the VPP configuration utility is
simple. First `install the python pip module <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__. Then using pip, 

Ubuntu: Install and Run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the terminal as root

::

    $ sudo -H bash

Afterwards, install vpp-config on root.

::

    # pip install vpp-config
    
Once vpp-config is installed simply type:

::

    # vpp-config 

    Welcome to the VPP system configuration utility

    These are the files we will modify:
        /etc/vpp/startup.conf
        /etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf
        /etc/default/grub

    Before we change them, we'll create working copies in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun
    Please inspect them carefully before applying the actual configuration (option 3)!

    What would you like to do?

    1) Show basic system information
    2) Dry Run (Will save the configuration files in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun for inspection)
            and user input in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/configs/auto-config.yaml
    3) Full configuration (WARNING: This will change the system configuration)
    4) List/Install/Uninstall VPP.
    5) Execute some basic tests.
    9 or q) Quit

    Command: 
    and answer the questions. If you are not sure what to answer choose the
    default. 

.. note::

    For yes or no questions the capital letter designates the default.  
    For example, for a question that shows [Y/n] Y is the default.
    For numbers the default is within the brackets for example for a question that shows [1024]. 1024 is the default.   

For Developers
--------------

Modifying the code is reasonable simple. Edit and debug the code from
the root directory. In order to do this, we need a script that will copy
or data files to the proper place. This is where they end up with pip
install. 

* Ubuntu

::

    /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config

* Centos

::
    
    /usr/vpp/vpp-config
    
Run this script to copy the relevant files correctly: 

::

    ./scripts/cp-data.sh

Run this script to clean the environment. 

::

    ./scripts/clean.sh
    
.. note:: 

    This allows the developer to start from scratch.
    
Steps to Run the Utility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are the steps to run the utility in this environment. The scripts are meant to be run from the *root directory*.

::

    ./scripts/clean.sh
    ./scripts/cp-data.sh
    ./vpp_config.pyÂ 

When the utility is installed with pip the wrapper scripts/vpp-config is
written to /usr/local/bin. However, the starting point when debugging
this script locally is

::

    ./vpp_config.py

 Run the utility by executing (from the root directory)

 ::

    ./vpp_config.py 

The start point in the code is in vpp_config.py. Most of the work is
done in the files in ./vpplib

Uploading to PyPi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To upload this utility to PyPi, simply do the following: 

.. note::
    Currently, I have my own account. When we want everyone to contribute we will need to change that. 

::

    $ sudo -H bash
    # cd vpp_config
    # python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    # twine upload dist/*

Command 1. Show System Information
-----------------------------------

Before Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the utility is first started we can show the basic system
information.

::

   # vpp-config

   Welcome to the VPP system configuration utility

   These are the files we will modify:
       /etc/vpp/startup.conf
       /etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf
       /etc/default/grub

   Before we change them, we'll create working copies in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun
   Please inspect them carefully before applying the actual configuration (option 3)!

   What would you like to do?

   1) Show basic system information
   2) Dry Run (Will save the configuration files in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun for inspection)
          and user input in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/configs/auto-config.yaml
   3) Full configuration (WARNING: This will change the system configuration)
   4) List/Install/Uninstall VPP.
   5) Execute some basic tests.

option will create the configuration files and put them in a dryrun
directory. This directory is located for Ubuntu in
/usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun and for Centos in
/usr/vpp/vpp-config/dryrun. These files should be examined to be sure
that they are valid before actually applying the configuration with

Command 5. Execute Basic tests
------------------------------------------------

Command 1. Set IPv4 Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once VPP is configured we can add some ip addresses to the configured
interfaces. Once this is done you should be able to ping the configured
addresses and VPP is ready to use. After this option, is run a script is
created in /usr/local/vpp/vpp-config/scripts/set_int_ipv4_and_up for
Ubuntu and /usr/vpp/vpp-config/scripts/set_int_ipv4_and_up for Centos.
This script can be used to configure the ip addresses in the future.
